# dsa-prep-tracker
DSA Prep Tracker is a web-based platform designed to help students and developers practice Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in a structured and progressive way. Unlike traditional practice platforms, it organizes problems topic-wise—from basic to advanced—providing a guided learning path instead of random problem solving.
